# Definition of Done

To consider a task complete, the following criteria must be met:

* The task fulfills all the acceptance criteria outlined in the corresponding user story
* Unit tests for all the features that require testing have been written and passed
* The code has passed the continuous integration (CI) build process without any errors or failures
* The feature has been successfully deployed to the staging environment
* If the customer doesn't approve the feature, we return the status to "In Progress" and the task is not considered done
