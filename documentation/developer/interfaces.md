# KORI interface

KORI API is a system that provides publicly available information regarding courses available in the University of Helsinki. It is accessed by using the interface [here](https://github.com/Kurssiesitieto/kurssiesitieto-ohtuprojekti/blob/main/backend/interfaces/koriInterface.js)

The interface can be used to fetch multiple courses simultaneously via searchCourses functionality, as well as fetching the information on a course using courseInfo

# Helsinki interface

This feature is unused, but potentially valuable for further development! :exclamation:

We failed to utilize this system due to limitations in time, the aim was to automatically construct the data in our database based on the data here

Helsinki interface can be used to fetch degree structures directly from the university itself. [Here](https://od.helsinki.fi/eduviewer/tree_by_code/KH50_005?lv=hy-lv-74) is an example structure of the Bachelor of Computer Science that can be fetched via the interface.
